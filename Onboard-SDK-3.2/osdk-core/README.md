## DJI Onboard SDK Core Library

This is the officially maintained DJI Onboard SDK library. The library provides a set of APIs for implementing the various functionality available through the [open protocol](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html). 

API class documentation is available (beta) through pre-generated Doxygen in this repository (available at doc/doxygen-doc/html/index.html). Documentation for the SDK has moved to the DJI Developer Website. Please refer to the [Programming Guide](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/application-development-guides/programming-guide.html) for more information. 

If you're new here, we recommend going through the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html).
