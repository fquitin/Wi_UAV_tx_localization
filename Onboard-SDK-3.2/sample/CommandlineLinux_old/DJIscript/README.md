#### Documentation has been revamped and moved to the DJI Developer Website. Please refer to [Commandline Linux Documentation](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/github-platform-docs/commandline/README.html). DJI Script is a minimal interactive implementation on the core library and the commandline sample referenced here is an user-facing implementation that builds on DJI script. 

If you're new here, we recommend going through the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html).
